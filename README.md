## üéØ Purpose

The dataset is designed for **machine learning-based intrusion detection** in **cyber-physical systems**. It was used to develop and evaluate classification models such as:

- üîç **XGBoost**
- üîç **Gradient Boosting**
- üîç **Random Forest**
- üîç **Logistic Regression**

These models were trained to detect network-level anomalies such as:
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Spoofing Attacks
- False Data Injection
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Source & Simulation

The data was generated from a virtual smart transportation WSN simulation using:

- üõ†Ô∏è **GNS3** for virtual sensor infrastructure setup  
- üß™ **Wireshark** for packet-level capture during attacks  
- üíª **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost)** for preprocessing and ML modeling  
- üß† **Manual attack scripting** (e.g., `hping3`, `mosquitto_pub`) for injection of abnormal behavior

## üìä Applications

This dataset is valuable for:

- Smart city and ITS security research
- Developing IDS/IPS for IoT-based WSNs
- Educational demos on network intrusion
- Benchmarking ML models for anomaly detection
